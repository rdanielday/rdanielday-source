I like to think that I've made informed choices in the layout and especially the typography of this website, but at the very least the choices I have made have been deliberate.<!-- more -->  

The most logical place to start is with the choice of body typeface. I've chosen to use Merriweather for not only the body copy but also the headings. For body, I like the density of this typeface. I feel that it has presence, and the tall x-height lends to easier viewing on a screen. Using the same typeface for the headings was a purely stylistic choice; I like the simplicity of using a single font throughout the majority of the website.

I have spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to perfect the lineheight and the measure to make reading as comfortable as possible. I currently have Merriweather set at 18px at desktop sizes and 16px on mobile sizes, and the lineheight for both is 1.5rem. I won't bore you with the exact details of setting the measure, but I will say that it sits at about 65 characters in length at every breakpoint. [Here's](https://alistapart.com/article/how-we-read) a fascinating article that inspired these choices. I might make a few microadjustments (because Sassline allows all of the twiddling anyone could ever want), but for now I am happy with the spacing.

While my personal taste runs monotone, I've chosen to stick with the traditional blue hyperlinks. Not only do I find them to have a certain retro web appeal, this is also an accessibility choice. There are many ways links can be indicated on the page, but the blue underlined text is unmistakeable.
