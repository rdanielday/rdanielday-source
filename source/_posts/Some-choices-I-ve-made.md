title: Some choices I've made

I like to think that I've made informed choices in the layout and especially the typography of this website, but at the very least the choices I have made have been deliberate.  

The most logical place to start is with the choice of body typeface. I've chosen to use Merriweather for not only the body copy but also the headings. For body, I like the density of this typeface. I feel that it has presence, and the tall x-height lends to easier viewing on a screen. Using the same typeface for the headings was a purely stylistic choice; I like the simplicity of using a single font throughout the majority of the website.
